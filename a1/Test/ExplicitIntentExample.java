 This code you provided does satisfy the caution about using explicit intents to 
 start services instead of implicit intents, as it uses an explicit intent to start a service with a specific action
 
 By using an explicit intent, you ensure that only the intended service can respond to the intent, 
 
 which is more secure than using an implicit intent that any service can potentially respond to. Additionally,
 
 using an explicit intent makes it clear to the user which service is being started, 
  
 which can help prevent confusion or mistrust.
